**Decentraland is a decentralized virtual reality platform powered by the Ethereum blockchain. Within the Decentraland platform, users can create, experience, and monetize their content and applications.**

[Enter and explore decentraland](https://play.decentraland.org)

The finite, traversable, 3D virtual space within Decentraland is called **LAND**, a non-fungible digital asset maintained in an Ethereum smart contract. Land is divided into **parcels** that are identified by cartesian coordinates (x,y). These parcels are permanently owned by members of the community and are purchased using MANA, Decentralandâ€™s cryptocurrency token. This gives users full control over the environments and applications that they create, which can range from anything like static 3D scenes to more interactive applications or games.
